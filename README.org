#+title: Speedy Parrot

Playing with WASM and Markov random fields for image processing. Specifically, a
black and white only filter (no shades of gray).

The WASM/JS glue is heavily inspired by [[https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/photon][photon-rs]]'s examples, which were a huge
help.

Live demo available here: https://speedy-parrot.alarsyo.net

Processes reasonably large images in a few seconds each!
